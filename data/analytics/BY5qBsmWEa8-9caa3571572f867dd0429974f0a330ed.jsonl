Cryptography is a method of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format. Only those who possess a special key can decrypt, or make it readable again. \n\nThis is used in many areas, such as secure communications, passwords and PIN numbers, and of course, in digital currencies like Bitcoin. \n\nSo, when we're discussing hashing in this lecture, we're talking about a specific technique used in cryptography. Does that help clarify things a bit?", "datetime": "2023-10-11T16:30:35.689738+00:00"}

The avalanche effect helps to prevent collisions, which occur when two different inputs produce the same hash output. This property also enhances the security of the hashing process. If a tiny change in the input data produces a drastically different output, it becomes nearly impossible to derive the original data from the hash. This is particularly important in password storage, for example.
